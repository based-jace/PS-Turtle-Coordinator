# PS-Turtle-Coordinator
Creates geometric shapes for Python's Turtle graphics based on Photoshop coordinates input by the user.

I developed this program to create my "Clockwork Turtle" program: https://github.com/jacemedlin/A-Clockwork-Turtle

The Turtle program was alright, but it's this practical height/width coordinator that I was really satisfied with.

To get the most accurate coordinates possible, change the constants to reflect your Photoshop canvas size. After you're finished,
just paste the output into your Turtle program. But before you do, remember to initalize the program by importing Turtle, setting penup(), and setting your pensize to whatever you want it to be..
